# FullStackApplication-TaskManager-V1
  (Fake)"Client" gave me an outline and description to produce a web application based off of the commonly used three-tier architecture. In this application, the client requested a single-page application including a task management section, to-do list, and a modern design. 

  In the task management section of the webpage, there will be three main features. First, being a dynamic calendar capable of updating with each week that passes including lines within each day indicating the hour and minute in increments of 30 minutes each. Second, is giving the user the ability to input a set of tasks for a specific set of times whether single or multiple tasks a day. Third, being that this set of tasks will be compiled into a to-do list shown in the aforementioned "To-Do" section. (Optional)May later add the ability to set prerequisite tasks along with the parent task submitted.

  In the To-Do section of the webpage, there will also be three main features. The To-Do page will give the client the ability to complete tasks with the option of including notes. Secondly, the submitted task will return a notification to the user describing how far ahead or behind the deadline the task was completed. Lastly, the client will have a client-side view of his task history available in the To-Do section, within that history the database will record the task completed or failed, how far ahead or behind the deadline the task was completed, the time, the date, and any corresponding notes written by the user along with the name of the task.


  I was given three prerequisites for this project, utilize Django, MongoDB, and use Docker to integrate them.

  I will note any difficulties, mistakes, and solutions to the problems I experience through this project to record specifically what I have learned, and how I had to resolve issues.
